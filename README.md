# Algorithms-Fundamentals-with-Java

The course provides algorithmic thinking skills and acquire skills in working with the main classes of algorithms used in practice: recursion and backtracking, recursion using variables, combinatorial algorithms, search, sorting and greedy algorithms, as well as graph theory - implementation in computer memory, traversal and finding the shortest path, you will also acquire skills in applying dynamic optimization in solving optimization problems.
